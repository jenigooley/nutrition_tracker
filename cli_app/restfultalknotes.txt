Api is abstration presented by one layer that calls to the next layer

Call graph with RPCs  - remote procedure call

Network Unreliaibility

    Partially dropped RPC? Bundle important actions together

    Dropped? retry

    Duplicated RPC ? REST!


## Representational State Transfer  :
    Show me what end results will be, don't tell me what to do.


RPC are hard

        express functions
        express return value
        express errors
        serialize and deserialize data

HTTP is an RPC protocol

    originally designed to transfer html ect but can do more
    use features http already had for RPC

Embrace HTTP verbs!

    probably don't put verb in URL
    use query params

Use Status Codes

Headers

    Content Type - used by both client and server to indicate datatype being sent 
    Accept is used by a client to request a specific type

Practicalities

    Separate subdomains for API and HTML
    DONt need more verbs, nouns are good

HTTP probably already does whatever feature you want.
