# nutrition_tracker
Tracks user's nutrition intake data and other physical data

##Synopsis

The main, ongoing project is in the alchemy_nutri directory.
An backend application that takes a food item and then stores the nutritional data for that user.
It also takes user menstruation and sex activity data. An interface that displays and compares this data is on the way.
This app uses Flask, SQLALchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy.


##Motivation

This project originally started as a learning exercise.
There is version built around the command line using raw SQL and python.
I plan to build an interactive interface that will visualize user data
and allow them to see how their diet effects other aspects of their physical life.
